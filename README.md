conda-store provides the familiarity and flexibility of conda environments, without compromising reliability for
collaborative settings.

conda-store is built to work for all team members from individual data scientists to administrators,
while making sure your team follows best practices throughout the environment life cycle:
from initial environment creation to using environments in a production machine.

## Key features

- **Flexibility**:
  - Users can create and update environments with the Graphical UI or a YAML editor.
  - The environments are automatically version-controlled and all versions are readily available.
- **Reproducibility**:
  - Users can share environments quickly through the auto-generated artifacts including a lockfile, docker image, YAML file, and tarball.
  - conda-store pins exact versions of all packages and their dependencies in all the auto-generated artifacts.
- **Governance**:
  - Users have access to admin-approved packages and channels for their work and can request new ones when needed.
  - Admins can insert or require certain packages and versions for organization-level compatibility.
  - Admins can manage users' access levels using "Namespaces", and allow users to share environments across (and only with) their team.
