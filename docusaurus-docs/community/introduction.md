# Welcome to conda-store!

conda-store is a set of open source tools for managing data science environments in collaborative teams. It provides flexible-yet-reproducible environments and a user-friendly graphical interface, while enforcing best practices throughout the environment's life cycle.

## Projects

conda-store consists of three projects which are developed on separate GitHub repositories. The each have separate spaces on our documentation site as well:

- [conda-store][conda-store-docs]: core library that provides all the key features through a REST API and CLI
- [conda-store-ui][conda-store-ui-docs]: web application (frontend) for accessing all the conda-store features
- [jupyterlab-conda-store][jupyterlab-conda-store-docs]: extension to access conda-store-ui within JupyterLab

:::note
The term "conda-store" is heavily overloaded, it can refer to the overall set of projects, the core repository, or the package based on context.
If the meaning is unclear in a discussion, don't hesitate to ask the people involved to clarify.

## Code of Conduct

The conda-store development team pledges to create a welcoming, supportive, and harassment-free space for everyone. All conda-store spaces, including GitHub conversations and video meetings, are covered by the [conda organization code of conduct](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Governance

As a [federated project](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/tree/main#federated-projects) under the [conda-incubator organization](https://github.com/conda-incubator), conda-store follows the [conda-incubator governance](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/tree/main#conda--conda-incubator-governance). The [conda-store development team (documented through GitHub Teams)](https://github.com/orgs/conda-incubator/teams) makes all project decisions using a [consent-based approach](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/consent-decision-making/) on the issue tracker or in team meetings.

## Support

conda-store's issue trackers are the best way to reach the conda-store development team. If you have any usage or contribution questions, open an issue on the corresponding repository following the [issue creation guidelines][issues]:

* [conda-store](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store/issues/new/choose)
* [conda-store-ui](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store-ui/issues/new/choose)
* [jupyterlab-conda-store](https://github.com/conda-incubator/jupyterlab-conda-store/issues/new/choose)

If you are unsure about the repository, open your issues against the `conda-store`` repository and the development team will move it to the relevant space.
