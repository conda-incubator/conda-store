# Welcome to conda-store!

Thanks for being a part of the conda-store community!

## Code of Conduct

The conda-store development team pledges to create a welcoming, supportive, and harassment-free space for everyone. All conda-store spaces, including GitHub conversations and video meetings, are covered by the [conda organization code of conduct](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Governance

As a [federated project](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/tree/main#federated-projects) under the [conda-incubator organization](https://github.com/conda-incubator), conda-store follows the [conda-incubator governance](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/tree/main#conda--conda-incubator-governance). The [conda-store development team (documented through GitHub Teams)](https://github.com/orgs/conda-incubator/teams) makes all project decisions using a [consent-based approach](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/consent-decision-making/) on the issue tracker or in team meetings.

## Support

conda-store's issue trackers are the best way to reach the conda-store development team. If you have any usage or contribution questions, please open an issue on the corresponding repository:

* [conda-store](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store/issues/new/choose)
* [conda-store-ui](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store-ui/issues/new/choose)
* [jupyterlab-conda-store](https://github.com/conda-incubator/jupyterlab-conda-store/issues/new/choose)

If you are unsure about the repository, open your issues against the `conda-store`` repository and the development team will move it to the relevant space.
