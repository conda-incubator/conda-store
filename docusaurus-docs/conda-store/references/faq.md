# Frequently asked questions

## conda-store fails to build Conda environment and worker is spontaneously killed (9 SIGKILL)

The following error most likely indicates that you have not allocated
enough memory to `conda-store-workers` for solving and building the
given environment. Solve this by increasing the memory allocated to
the container.

```shell
Process 'ForkPoolWorker-31' pid:90 exited with 'signal 9 (SIGKILL)'

Task handler raised error: WorkerLostError('Worker exited prematurely: signal 9 (SIGKILL) Job: 348.')

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/conda/envs/conda-store-server/lib/python3.9/site-packages/billiard/pool.py", line 1265, in mark_as_worker_lost

    raise WorkerLostError(

billiard.exceptions.WorkerLostError: Worker exited prematurely: signal 9 (SIGKILL) Job: 348.
```

## Why are environment builds stuck in building state?

Recently conda-store added a feature to cleanup builds which are stuck
in the BUILDING state and are not currently running on the
workers. This feature only works for certain brokers
e.g. redis. Database celery brokers are not supported.

This issue occurs when the worker spontaneously dies. This can happen
for several reasons:

- worker is killed due to consuming too much memory (conda solver/builds can consume a lot of memory)
- worker was killed for other reasons e.g. forced restart
- bugs in conda-store

## Build path length

Conda packages are guaranteed to be [relocatable] as long as the environment
prefix length is <= 255 characters. In conda-store, the said prefix is specified
in `Build.build_path`. When building an environment, you might see an error like
this:

```
build_path too long: must be <= 255 characters
```

If so, try configuring the conda-store `CondaStore.store_directory` to be as
close to the filesystem root as possible. Additionally, 255 characters is also a
common limit for individual files on many filesystems. When creating
environments, try using shorter `namespace` and `environment` names since they
affect both the `build_path` length and the filename length.

## Build key versions

The part of the build path that identifies a particular environment build is the
build key. Originally, conda-store used the following format, known as version
1:

```
c7afdeffbe2bda7d16ca69beecc8bebeb29280a95d4f3ed92849e4047710923b-20231105-035410-510258-12345678-this-is-a-long-environment-name
^ (1)                                                            ^ (2)                  ^ (3)    ^ (4)
```

It consists of:
1. a SHA-256 hash of the environment specification
   (`CondaSpecification`, which represents a user-provided environment, is
   converted to a dict and passed to `datastructure_hash`, which recursively sorts
   it and calculates the SHA-256 hash)
2. a human-readable timestamp (year, month, day, `-`, hour, minute, second, `-`, microsecond)
3. the id of a build
4. the environment name.

To help mitigate build path length issues, a shorter build key format was
introduced, known as version 2:

```
c7afdeff-1699156450-12345678-this-is-a-long-environment-name
^ (1)    ^ (2)      ^ (3)    ^ (4)
```

It consists of:
1. a truncated SHA-256 hash of the environment specification
   (`CondaSpecification`, which represents a user-provided environment, is
   converted to a dict and passed to `datastructure_hash`, which recursively sorts
   it and calculates the SHA-256 hash)
2. a Unix timestamp
3. the id of a build
4. the environment name.

The version 2 format is now the default. Environments created using the version
1 format will continue to be accessible in the UI, but new builds will use the
version 2 format. No changes are needed for existing deployments of conda-store.

There is no real reason to use the version 1 format anymore, but it can be
explicitly set via the config:

```
c.CondaStore.build_key_version = 1
```

The version 2 format can also be explicitly set if needed (this is the same as
the default):

```
c.CondaStore.build_key_version = 2
```

## Long paths on Windows

conda-store supports Windows in standalone mode. However, when creating
environments with certain packages, you may see errors like

```
ERROR:root:[WinError 206] The filename or extension is too long: 'C:\\...'
```

This error is due to the fact that Windows has a limitation that file paths
cannot be more than 260 characters. The fix is to set the registry key
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled
(Type: REG_DWORD)` to `1`, which removes this MAX_PATH limitation. See [this
Microsoft support
article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation)
for more details on how to set this registry key.

If it is not possible to set this registry key, for instance, because you do
not have access to administrator privileges, you should configure the
conda-store `CondaStore.store_directory` to be as close to the filesystem root
as possible, so that the total length of the paths of package files is
minimized.

See [conda-store issue
#588](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store/issues/588) for more
details.

## What are the resource requirements for `conda-store-server`

`conda-store-server` is a web server and should not require any specific resources.
1 GB of RAM and 1 CPU should be plenty.

`conda-store-worker` does the actual builds of the conda environments.
Solving for conda environments can take a lot of memory in some circumstances.
Make sure to allocate at least 4 GB of RAM to the worker along with at least one CPU.
