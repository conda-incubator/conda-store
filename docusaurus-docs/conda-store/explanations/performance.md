# Performance

There are several parts of conda-store to consider for performance. We
have tried to list them in order of performance impact that may be
seen.

### Worker storage

When conda-store builds a given environment it has to locally install
the environment in the directory specified in the
[Traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_traitlets.html)
configuration `CondaStore.store_directory`. Conda environments consist
of many hardlinks to small files. This means that the
`store_directory` is limited to the number of
[IOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOPS) the directory can
perform. Many cloud providers have high performance storage
options. These include:

If you do not need to mount the environments via NFS into the
containers we highly recommend not using NFS and using traditional
block storage. Not only is it significantly cheaper but the IOPs
performance will be better as well.

If you want to mount the environments in containers or running VMs NFS
may be a good option for you. With NFS many cloud providers provide a
high performance filesystem option at a significant premium in
cost. Example of these include [GCP
Filestore](https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/performance#expected_performance),
[AWS EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/features/), and [Azure
files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/understanding-billing#provisioning-method). Choosing
an nfs storage option with low IOPS will result in long environment
install times.

### Network speed

While Conda does its best to cache packages, it will have to reach out
to download the `repodata.json` along with the packages as well. Thus
network speeds may be important. Typically cloud environments have
plenty fast Internet.

### S3 storage

All build artifacts from conda-store are stored in object storage that
behaves S3 like. S3 traditionally has great performance if you use the
cloud provider implementation.
