# Conda concepts

conda is a Python package and environment manager, used widely in the Python data science ecosystem.
conda-store build on conda and other supporting libraries in the conda community.
This page briefly covers some key conda concepts necessary to use conda-store.
For detailed explanations, check out the [conda documentation][conda-docs].

## Python package

Open source software projects (sometimes called libraries) are shared with users as *packages*. You need to "install" the package on your local workspace to use it.

[pip][pip-docs] and [conda][conda-docs] are popular package management tools in the Python ecosystem.

pip ships with the Python programming language, and can install packages from the PyPI (Python Package Index) - a community managed collection of packages, public/private PyPI mirrors, GitHub sources, and local directories.

conda needs to be downloaded separately (through a distribution like Anaconda or Miniconda), and can install packages from conda [*channels*](#channels) and local builds.

Some Python packages depend on non-Python code (for example, NumPy includes some C libraries). Installing such packages from PyPI using pip can be un-reliable and sometimes it can be your responsibility to separately install the non-Python libraries.
However, conda provides a package management solution that includes both Python and other underlying non-Python code.

## Dependencies

Modern open source software (and software in general) is created using or builds on other libraries, which are called the *dependencies* of the project.
For example, pandas uses NumPy's `ndarray`s and is written partially in Python, hence, NumPy and Python are dependencies of pandas.
Specifically, they are the direct dependencies.
The dependencies of NumPy and pandas, and the dependencies of those dependencies, and so on creates a complete dependency graph for pandas.

Since conda-store focuses on [environments](#environments), the terms *dependencies* usually refers to the full set of compatible dependencies for all the packages specified in an environment.

## Channels (conda)

The [conda documentation][conda-docs-channels] defines:

> Conda channels are the locations where packages are stored. They serve as the base for hosting and managing packages. Conda packages are downloaded from remote channels, which are URLs to directories containing conda packages.

Similar to PyPI, conda channels are URLs of remote servers that manage packages.

In conda-store, packages are installed from the [conda-forge][conda-forge] channel by default.
conda-forge is a community maintained channel for hosting open source libraries.

:::note
This behavior is different from conda downloaded from Anaconda/Miniconda distribution, that gets packages from the "default" channel by default.

Other distributions like Miniforge also use conda-forge as the default channel.
:::

## Environments

conda-store helps create and manage "conda environments", sometimes also referred to as "data science environments" or simply "environments" in conda-store spaces.

An environment is an isolated set of installed packages.
The [official conda documentation][conda-docs-environments] states:

> A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages that you have installed.
>
> If you change one environment, your other environments are not affected. You can easily activate or deactivate environments, which is how you switch between them.

In data science and development workflows, you often use different environments for different projects and sub-projects. It gives you a clean space for development with only the packages and versions that you need for the specific project. You can also use different versions of the same package in different environments depending on your project needs.

Using isolated environments is a good practice to follow. The alternative, where requirements for all projects are added to a single "base" environment can not only give you un-reliable results but also be very tedious to manage across projects.

## Environment specification (spec)

conda environments are specified through a YAML file, which is called the *environment specification* and has the following major components:

```yaml
name: my-cool-env # name of your environment
channels:   # conda channels to get packages from, in order of priority
   - conda-forge
   - default
dependencies:  # list of packages required for your work
   - python >=3.10
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn
   - nodejs # conda can install non-Python packages as well, if it's available on a channel
   - pip
   - pip:   # Optionally, conda can also install packages using pip if needed
      - pytest
```

conda uses this file to create a conda *environment*.

:::tip
In some cases, installing packages using pip through conda can cause issues dependency conflicts. We suggest you use the `pip:` section only if the package you need is not available on conda-forge.

## Environment creation

Given an `environment.yaml` file, this is how conda performs a build (in brief):

1. Conda downloads `channeldata.json`, a metadata file from each of the channels which
   list the available architectures.

2. Conda then downloads `repodata.json` for each of the architectures
   it is interested in (specifically your particular compute architecture along
   with noarch[^1]). The `repodata.json` has fields like package name,
   version, and dependencies.

[^1]: noarch is a cross-platform architecture which has no OS-specific files. Read [noarch packages in the conda documentation][conda-docs-noarch] for more information.

:::tip
You may notice that the channels listed in the YAML do not have a URL. This
is because in general , non-URL channels are expected to be present at `https://conda.anaconda.org/<channel-name>`.
:::

3. Conda then performs a *solve* to determine the exact version and
   sha256 of each package to download.

4. The specific packages are downloaded.

For a detailed walkthrough, check out the [conda install deep dive in the conda documentation][conda-docs-install].

## Conda configuration (`conda config`)

You can configure various behaviors in conda through the [`.condarc` configuration file][conda-docs-config].

conda-store needs to configure some parts of conda without modifying your conda configuration file, for this conda-store (internally) sets some conda
configuration variables using environment variables.

The impact of this is that if you try to print your conda configuration with [`conda config --show` CLI command][conda-docs-config-cli], some configuration settings displayed by that command will not reflect the values that are actually used by conda-store.

In particular, `conda-store` internally sets `CONDA_FLAGS=--strict-channel-priority`, overriding the channel priority in the conda configuration file. Keep this in mind when using `conda config` to inspect your conda configuration and when viewing the build logs.
