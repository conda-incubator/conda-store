# conda-store (core)

The [`conda-store` repository on GitHub][conda-store-repo] consists of two separate, yet related, packages:

- **`conda-store-server`**: web server and workers that together provide the `conda-store` "service" through a REST API
- **`conda-store` (client)**: a client that interacts with the service to offer a user-facing command line interface (CLI)

## Get started âœ¨

The fastest way to get started with conda-store is with a [**local standalone installation**][standalone-install/introduction]
and the [**conda-store UI**][conda-store-ui-tutorials/introduction].

Alternatively, you can use some features of conda-store through the [CLI commands][cli-ref/introduction] or as a [shebang][shebang/introduction].

* [Essentials for users new to the conda packaging ecosystem][conda-concepts/introduction]
* [Concepts and vocabulary unique to conda-store][conda-store-concepts/introduction]
* [Descriptions for the artifacts created by conda-store][artifacts/introduction]

## Other installation options ðŸ’»

conda-store can also be installed using:

* [Docker][install-docker/introduction]
* [Kubernetes][install-kubernetes/introduction]
* [Vagrant][install-vagrant/introduction]

## Deeper dive ðŸ“š
