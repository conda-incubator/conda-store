# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support only the latest version and we follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/), so all minor and patch releases are backwards compatible.

You should feel comfortable upgrading if you're using our documented public APIs and pay attention to `DeprecationWarnings`. Whenever there is a need to break compatibility, it is announced in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and raises a `DeprecationWarning` before it's finally really broken.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, please report it at [conda-store/security](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store/security).
