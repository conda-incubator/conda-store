# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support only the latest version, and we use [CalVer](https://calver.org/) for versioning.

> **Note** > `conda-store` migrated to CalVer in September 2023, and the last version before that was [`0.4.15`](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store/releases/tag/v0.4.15.2).

You should feel comfortable upgrading if you're using our documented public APIs and pay attention to `DeprecationWarnings`. Whenever there is a need to break compatibility, it is announced in the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and will raise a `DeprecationWarning` before it's finally really broken.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, please report it at [conda-store/security](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-store/security).
